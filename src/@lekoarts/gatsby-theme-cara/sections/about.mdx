## Personal Values

> Life Long Learning 

This has a huge impact why I love my job. I love to learn new things, technologies, new features, which can be really challenging and also overwhelming sometimes but at the time it keeps me motivated and I never want to stop till I found out why.

> Teamwork 

People make work great. Learning from each other, laughing together, spending good moments, celebrating success and also help each other when things do not work like it should. Everything is better together and together we are stronger, smarter and faster.

> Fail forward and take responsibility

Failures are a part of life. If you make them, you learn, if you don't make any, you don't make anything. In a ideal culture we should accept when failures happened, we should take responsibility for it, clean it, learn from it and it is not going to happen again.

> Take calulated risks

We live in a world that is rapidly evolving. If we want to stay with it, we sometimes have to take risks and try new things. But these should be calculated and, if possible, based on data.

> Respect and Tolerance

Respect is one of my most important values based on my experience. No matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what you do, all people deserve to be treated with respect. No one is better or worse because everyone does their best out of their own situation.

> Honestly and Feedback

I believe that you can say everything honestly without hurting or attacking anyone. Above all, the right choice of words plays a decisive role. Because feedback gives you the opportunity to look at yourself from a different perspective and to develop further. Nobody is perfect, and nobody will be perfect, but we can get closer to being almost perfect.
