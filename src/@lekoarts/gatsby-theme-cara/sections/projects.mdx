  It was an final project of Udacity.com and is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. 
  This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.
  I built the data models to power the API endpoints by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information.

  Since I love to cook and bake I am going to build my own recipe page where I can add, edit, find and delete new recipe pages.
  For better search every recipe will be targeted by labels with which you are able to find new recipes in your database that fit to your needs.
